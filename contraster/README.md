## Notes

- The `manifest.json` file is how Figma identifies plugins.
- `npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings`.
- "A plugin runs in a _sandbox_ inside of Figma, isolated from the rest of the application (...) we donâ€™t have access to the browser APIs."
- "Anytime we need access to the browser APIs we have to launch an `iframe` and send messages to it."
- [Node Types](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/api/nodes/).
- Luminance is the apparent brightness of a color.
